# Const Comp List Demo

## Description
This app is a simple coding challenge given by an undisclosed company.

# Setup
The application will install itself if the `make` command is available.

Simply running `make` (or `make dev`) is enough.

The process will install meteor using the [official install script](https://install.meteor.com/). This is the traditional way to install meteor. Recently a global [meteor npm install package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor) is also available to reach the same result, but that is more obtrusive.
